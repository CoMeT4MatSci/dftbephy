# Documentation

This documentation accompanies **DFTBephy**, a DFTB-based workflow for **electron–phonon interaction** calculations, including electronic band structures, electron–phonon couplings (EPC), scattering rates (relaxation times), and charge transport properties such as conductivities.


- **Input file** (`dftbephy_in.hsd`): description of the main HSD input format and the available calculation blocks

- **Source code**: the implementation is openly available on GitHub
  branches:
  - workflows for EPC calculations with self-consistent charges (frozen charge model) and non-SCC
  - workflow for self-consistent EPC calculations at each displacement

- **Publications**: papers using DFTBephy and citation information

We also provide scripts to run the main calculations (bands, EPC, scattering rates, conductivities). These scripts are actively being improved and will be updated soon.
