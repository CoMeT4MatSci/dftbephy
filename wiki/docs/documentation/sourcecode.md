# Source Code

The DFTBephy source code is openly available on GitHub at
[`https://github.com/CoMeT4MatSci/dftbephy`](https://github.com/CoMeT4MatSci/dftbephy).

The repository provides our implementation for calculating electron–phonon couplings with DFTB, as well as electronic band structures and relaxation times, building on [DFTB+](https://dftbplus.org/about/index.html) and [phonopy](http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/reference.html). It includes example workflows, input templates, and Jupyter notebooks that reproduce selected results from the published applications. The code is distributed under the MIT license. For the underlying methodology and example studies, please refer to the following publications.
